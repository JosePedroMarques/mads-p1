# Hack-a-thon Description

During the recent efforts to make Portugal get out of its debt crisis, an investment has been made to build a diamond mining facility in Alentejo. Because we may run out of money to fund R&D before the end of this year, an underground survey technology was borrowed from "nuestros irmanos" and already implemented at the mining site. Hence, we have maps of all the mines.

The government as therefore initiated a public bidding to find the most promising contractor (such as you) that is able to route a Robot throughout the diamond mine, retrieve all the diamonds, avoid any obstacles (such as falling rocks), and lift the diamonds back to the surface.

Note, however, that the surveying technology is probably not perfect. It is possible we will discover more things underground that we did not expect. We will let you know as the bidding progresses.
