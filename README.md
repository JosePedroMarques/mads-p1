# Introduction

This is the problem description for the first MADS hack-a-thon, taken place at FEUP, Wednesday 26th September 2012. Please **follow the instructions** on this page and **read until the end**.

# Hack-a-thon Description

During the recent efforts to make Portugal get out of its debt crisis, an investment has been made to build a diamond mining facility in Alentejo. Because we may run out of money to fund R&D before the end of this year, an underground survey technology was borrowed from "nuestros hermanos" and already implemented at the mining site. Hence, we have maps of all the mines.

The government has therefore initiated a public bidding to find the most promising contractor (such as you) that is able to route a Robot throughout the diamond mine, retrieve all the diamonds, avoid any obstacles (such as falling rocks), and lift the diamonds back to the surface.

Note, however, that the surveying technology is probably not perfect. It is possible we will discover more things underground that we did not expect. We will let you know as the bidding progresses.

# Schedule

This exercise takes place at room B215, with the following distribution:

* Day Shift Groups (14h - 21h)
```
    14:00 Sprint 1
    15:30 Sprint 2
    17:00 Pause
    18:00 Sprint 3
    19:30 Sprint 4
    21:00 End
```

* Night Shift Groups (17h - 00h)
```
    17:00 Sprint 1
    18:30 Sprint 2
    20:00 Pause
    21:00 Sprint 3
    22:30 Sprint 4

# Tools

The use of the following tools are compulsory for all groups:

* Programming Language: [Java 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7u7-downloads-1836413.html)
* Testing Infrastructure: [JUnit](http://www.junit.org)
* Version Control System: [Git](http://git-scm.com) through [GitHub](https://github.com)
* Building System: [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org) or [Maven](http://maven.apache.org) or [Ant](http://ant.apache.org)
* Continuous Integration: [Travis](http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/languages/java/) with [Github Integration](http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/getting-started/)
* Operating System: Any

The github project **should be initialized as a fork of this project** (yes, the one you're reading). One member of the group should click the button (on the top right) that says "Fork". Then, choose your group folder and start developing there. **Do not make pull requests until after midnight**. After all merge requests, this repository will act as a unified host to all projects.
